The region struggles with vast quantities of waste accumulating daily, leading to significant environmental and health hazards. Poor waste management practices result in soil and groundwater contamination, air quality deterioration, and increased economic and environmental pressures on local communities. These issues are compounded by the lack of effective recycling infrastructure, causing valuable resources to be wasted. By providing efficient waste sorting and recycling solutions, Glean aims to transform these challenges into opportunities. We focus on converting plastic bags into interlocking tiles, turning organic waste into compost, and recycling cardboard into egg trays. Our solutions not only mitigate environmental damage but also promote sustainability, create job opportunities, and contribute to the local economy. Through innovative recycling processes, Glean is committed to fostering a cleaner and healthier environment for Gaza and beyond.","The problem addressed by Glean primarily affects the residents of Gaza, Palestine. These include families living in urban and rural areas who are directly impacted by poor waste management practices. The lack of efficient recycling infrastructure affects their daily lives, causing environmental and health hazards such as soil and groundwater contamination and deteriorating air quality. This issue extends to local businesses and industries that struggle with waste disposal and resource scarcity, hindering their growth and sustainability efforts. Additionally, municipal authorities face significant challenges in managing waste effectively, leading to increased economic pressures and inefficiencies. Our target audience also includes young entrepreneurs and job seekers who can benefit from the job opportunities created through our recycling initiatives. By addressing these issues, Glean aims to improve the quality of life for Gaza’s residents, promote environmental sustainability, and contribute to the economic stability and growth of the region.","Glean's total addressable market (TAM) encompasses the entire population of the Gaza Strip, which is approximately 2 million residents. This includes households, local businesses, and industries that are all impacted by inadequate waste management and recycling infrastructure. The geographic focus is on urban and rural areas across Gaza, where waste accumulation and environmental degradation are most pronounced. Additionally, the market extends to government entities and municipalities responsible for waste management. By addressing these needs, Glean has the potential to significantly improve environmental conditions and public health for a substantial portion of the population, while also creating economic opportunities through job creation and resource optimization.",,,"Glean's solution stands out from existing market offerings through its comprehensive and innovative approach to waste management and recycling. Unlike traditional methods, Glean integrates advanced automated sorting technology, ensuring efficient and precise waste separation. Our unique process of recycling plastic bags into durable, weather-resistant interlock tiles not only addresses plastic waste but also provides a sustainable building material, crucial for Gaza's reconstruction efforts.

Our focus on community empowerment through job creation and environmental education further differentiates Glean, making it a holistic solution that addresses both environmental and socio-economic challenges in the Gaza Strip.","Glean implements Islamic principles by embracing Ihsaan (excellence) and environmental stewardship (Khilaafah) in all aspects of our operations. We are committed to the principles of sustainability and responsible resource management, which align with the Islamic concept of conservation and avoiding waste (Israf). By recycling materials and turning waste into valuable products, we embody the principle of stewardship over the Earth, as guided by Islamic teachings.

Our approach to business also includes the values of justice ('Adl) and compassion (Rahmah). We ensure fair wages and ethical treatment for all our employees, reflecting the Islamic principle of social justice. Additionally, Glean is dedicated to serving the community by creating job opportunities and enhancing the quality of life in Gaza, particularly through our role in the post-war reconstruction efforts.

Glean's business practices are transparent and honest, adhering to the principle of trustworthiness (Amanah). We maintain integrity in all our dealings, ensuring that our environmental impact is positive and our contributions to society are genuine. By integrating these Islamic principles, Glean not only aims to improve environmental sustainability but also to foster a just and compassionate community.",In market,Pre Seed,Yes,"As a result of our innovative approach to waste management and recycling, Glean has achieved significant traction to date.

Firstly, we need technical expertise and mentorship to optimize our recycling processes and ensure operational efficiency. Secondly, access to a robust network of industry contacts would facilitate partnerships and collaborations essential for growth. Thirdly, legal and regulatory guidance would help us navigate compliance and secure necessary permits. Additionally, support in marketing and public relations would enhance our visibility and outreach efforts, helping us engage with the community and potential customers. Finally, ongoing training and capacity-building programs for our staff would ensure we maintain high standards of quality and innovation in our operations. This comprehensive non-financial support would be instrumental in driving Glean's mission forward.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/glean-palestine,"Glean's journey is a testament to resilience and innovation, especially amidst the challenges faced in Gaza.

In April 2017 crisis turned into catastrophe. More than 2.1 million people have been living under less than three hours of electricity a day. People can’t work, can’t study and even cannot run a business. Politics failed us, so we decided to bring a solution ourselves. 

On the bigger picture, millions of people and the Middle East are living with no electricity. Those unprivileged communities have Talents and dreams like any normally human being And so they deserve to have a regular life with the basic human needs.","That’s why we introduced SunBox to the market.

Our vision
We are dreaming of the day where all Muslims across the Middle East have a decent life, a Life they deserve. Through sunbox, We want to bring independency through energy for our Muslim brothers and sisters. We envision sunbox company to lead towards this change.","Our Business Model
SunBox customizes and imports solar systems according to people's electricity needs and their financial limitations. We currently are running as a hybrid
company with nonprofit and for profit arms. Due to the current economic crisis, families can not afford paying the full price, so we subsidize the household solar installations(1kw-3kw) up to 50% using the donations we raise so we can match their needs. At the same time, we run as a for profit company through providing systems of high capacity for companies and institutes, and then we reinvest part of the revenues into the subsidy model.

us with nearly no competition with most of the existing participants. We are the only hybrid solar company that runs mainly as a social enterprise and the main goal is to provide electricity more than maximizing profits.","We focus on the impact more than the return. For us, providing people with decent source of energy and make them independent as our core value. In Terms of financing, We follow Islamic principles only and we don’t deal with any non-Islamic loans Or financing.

Pandai is based in Malaysia, and has launched in some SE Asia markets.

Problem statement:
Schools students in Malaysia do not get individualized feedback in schools, due to the large class size (average >40 students per class). Although students are provided with report cards that shows their exam results, in general students do not know their strengths and weaknesses for each subject, and how to improve their performance.

More affluent students can afford to get personal tutors or tuition classes with small class sizes to get more personalized instructions and feedback. For example, parents in Malaysia spend US$900 (on average) on tuition classes and workbooks. Pandai aims to disrupt these markets and provide quality, personalized education to primary and secondary students using technology.","We focus on
- primary and secondary school students (aged 7-17);
- teachers of primary and secondary schools.

Currently, we have more than 800,000 users on the platform.

The demographics are:
- 65% primary schools (7-12 years old)
- 55% girls
- 25% from rural areas
- almost regularly distributed among all states in Malaysia, factoring in the states' populations.","These are the addressable markets for our solution:
Malaysian public school students - 5 million
SE Asian public school students - 100 million.

We are focusing on the SE Asian market due to:
- similarity in culture
- close collaboration between education system and national curriculum. For example, there is an intergovernmental body called SEAMEO that coordinates education systems in 11 SE Asian countries.
- widespread use of English (Philippines, Brunei, Singapore) and languages similar to Malay (Indonesia, Brunei).","Vision: To provide students with affordable, high-quality, personalized education to improve their academic performance, and thus giving them a brighter future.

North Star: To provide positive impact at least 1 million users in Malaysia and 10 million users in Southeast Asia with our solutions by 2030.","There are two components of the solution
1. Pandai App: An app that has been launched since 2020 with 800k+ users to date.
2. PandaiAI: AI tools which has been developed since 2023, to be integrated on the Pandai app.

Features:

1. Pandai App

1(a). Personalized Content
Pandai has developed more than 1 million content (assessment and learning materials), aligned with the national curriculum of the markets in which we launched. All content are mapped to the national curricula at the most granular level, so students will get the materials taught in the schools. Each content is provided with meta-data so students can get personalized content based on their performance level.

1(b). Gamification
In Pandai, we aim to motivate students to learn using various gamification elements. Students collect points for each correct answer, and they will be placed in leaderboards that is updated live. They also collect badges by completing special tasks. We introduce an in-app coins that students can collect by answering questions and doing other activities, and these coins can be redeemed for various vouchers (F&B, e-commerce vouchers, and gaming currencies, e.g., Robux). 

1(c). Interactive Classes
In addition to the app that they can access at anytime, we also provide a tuition class every day, each lasting an hour. The tuition classes cover all subjects from Year 1 to Form 5 (equivalent to Grade 1 to 11), with one class per subject per week. The tutors are trained by the Pandai team to ensure that they can deliver the materials with clarity and in a fun way.

1(d). Intelligent Analytics
In Pandai, students get not just a report card of their current performance for each subject, but a detailed explanation for the result of each subject, drilled down to each chapter, by difficulty and by levels of thinking skills. For example, suppose Ali gets a C in Science. The Pandai app drills down his performance to each topic (e.g., he is performing at A- level for Topic 1.2, but at D level for Topic 3.4), and provides a recommendation of topics that he should focus on. This allows students to get personalized feedback to improve their academic performance.

1(e). Extra-curricular Value Add
Pandai provides several non-academic features, such as:
- Pandai Personality - a psychometric instrument to gauge students profile, and suggesting suitable courses and career choices for the future;
- Contest Preparation - preparatory materials for various national and international level academic competitions and olympiads;
- Pandai University Matching - matching students with universities based on their academic performance and interests.

Netflix and Games for Muslim Children

THE PROBLEM.
Muslim parents all around the world are struggling to find safe and Islamic value driven content, games and platforms for their children. 

With more unethical content, LGBT content, soft porn content, inappropriate live streaming content, unetchical ads, addictive and harmful games - parents are facing major challenges navigating the media landscape for their kids.

Even worse, the screen is damaging our kids. It is exposing our kids to agendas and bad things that they shouldn't be exposed to - especially before they are 12 years old.

OUR BIG WHY.

To Nurture an Ummah with Eeman, Akhlaq and Ilm

We understand that giving a strong foundation for our Muslim children is essential in nurturing them to become good Muslims for our future Ummah. And we believe that in today's world, media plays a huge part.

Note: We are the team that created Omar & Hana
 ","THE CORE AUDIENCE.

400 Million Muslim Children under 12 years old.

THE BUYERS.

Even though our core audience are children. The Buyers are the parents. All parents want the best for their children and we are solving a big problem. 

For that reason, we believe parents are willing to invest in the subscription for the betterment of their children.

THE BUYERS (SECONDARY)

It takes a village to raise a child. We can also get subscriptions from kindergartens, schools, madrasahs, masjids, communities and even companies.","There are roughly 100 Million Muslim families (with children less than 12 years old) impacted by the dangers of content and media.

Assuming our average price of subscription per month is USD3
(US - $5.90, Canada - $5.90, UK - £5.90, Malaysia, Indonesia - $2.80)

The Total Addressable Market is 100,000,000 x US$3 x 12 = US$ 3.6 Billion Annually.

To be a unicorn, we only need 3% of the TAM, which is 3 Million subscribers. We believe this is very doable.

How did we project 100 Million Muslim Families?
1. 2 Billion Muslims
2. Estimated 400 Million (20%) of Muslims are below 12 years old
3. Estimated 1 family has 4 children : 100 Million Muslim families

It is a huge ask to reach the 400 million Muslim children. But we believe we can do it. We have to do our best to do it. InshaAllah.","The vision is Nurture an Ummah with Eeman, Akhlaq and Ilm.

We want to impact as many Muslim children all around the world by providing fun, safe, ethical and Islamic value driven content and games.

Imagine if our Muslim children grow up watching good content for them (and not watching the bad content in the world today). It would be Ummah changing.

My late father once told me. ""You are what you eat. You are what you read.""

That is so true. In our world today - we can extend that to ""You are what you watch!"".

Our North Star Metrics is SUBSCRIBERS through Durioo+ and Durioo Games.

However, there is so much beyond that. Durioo Education, Durioo Merchandises, Durioo Theme Attractions, Durioo Events, Durioo Commerce and inshaAllah Durioo Foundation.

2. We only license content aligned with our mission (but the content is still fun).
3. We filter and edit all the content that goes on the platform.
4. Before the children watch any content on Durioo+, there will be a short filler content inculcating Islamic teachings (similar to YouTube ads - but we dont have ads - we have short good messages).
5. We work with Shariah consultants to ensure all the Islamic teachings are Sahih from the Quran and Sunnah.
6. We have Durioo+ Creators. A program similar to YouTube or Tik Tok Creators. The difference is the content the Durioo+ Creators are content with benefit.
7. Apply what we learned while doing Omar & Hana - and applying that into all our new content and implementation of our platform.

One thing for sure. We are doing this for the right reasons. We will not put addictive features for the sake of addicting the children. We have the right principles on niyyah to do it right. InshaAllah.

This results in the unfortunate catastrophic failure of critical infrastructure like buildings and bridges. Today we have 7 catastrophic structural failures around the world every day. We also have an issue inspecting structurally compromised assets safely. 

Our solution leverages the power of AI to automate the task of defect detection on structures. From just images, we reconstruct a high resolution, photorealistic model and then AI examines the data to show defects (such as cracks and spalls) in true 3 dimensions. ","We are focused on enabling engineering companies doing inspection whether it's for an established community or disaster relief. 

Our technology enables a near real time understanding of the condition of a structure's health. 

","TAM is over $80B. Our technology has no geographic boundaries and can be used anywhere in the world. We are especially hopeful to help with relief efforts for Muslims in affected areas like Gaza. 

We are also especially applicable in regions with aging infrastructure which will benefit society worldwide. ","We are building the Ultimate Inspection Tool. 

ConeLabs will be the standard of how inspections are done world wide. There is no need for the task to continue to be done dangerously in the field and manually in the office. 

Our solution keeps inspectors on the ground and safe, and the automation of inspection reduces the risk of human oversight. 

In addition, our solution will enable engineering companies to unlock new revenue streams, selling SaaS services. They will also have a better handle on the health of a structure since our platform tracks changes over time. 

","Our solution allows field teams to safely collect data using UAVs such as drones, digital cameras and even cell phones. We keep workers on the ground vs. suspended from ropes. 

ConeLabs' technology is completely built end-to-end in-house. This allows us to have full control of our roadmap, ensuring that we can be flexible to prioritize customer feedback. 

Our platform only needs imagery. The imagery is used to reconstruct a high resolution, photorealistic model that provides a rich visual of the spatial relationship of elements of the structure. 

The AI powered engine then gets to work and identifies defects in the structure. Defects include cracks, spalls and rust (more to come). All defects are in true 3D. They are identified, categorized, can be shared with a simple url and can be exported to a table / final report. 

Our platform automatically generates reports that indicate defects, suggest a remedial action plan, and indicate what has changed since the previous scan.

The automation of some of these monotonous tasks free up inspector time to perform higher level inspections. Often times, they are so occupied with the arduous task of finding small defects that they don't have the chance to conduct in-depth, secondary inspection on structures. 

We save our customers time, and unlock the potential for them to do more projects, hire best in class talent, and most importantly, do more projects and prevent the catastrophic failure of structures that we see today.  ","Today our customers primarily perform the task manually. It was only recently that technology allowed us to build a solution to the manual problem of inspections. 

There are however other technologies that are emerging. We are differentiated because we have an IP protected technology that allows us to truly identify in 3D, and to continually improve our AI training from user interactions. 

ConeLabs GTM is also focused on channel partnerships vs project based work. We believe that this approach will allow us to scale faster and to reach a wider audience. ","Implementing Islamic principles in ConeLabs' AI inspection software focuses on values of human dignity, data privacy, respect, education, research.

We prioritize the sanctity of human lives (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:32). Our software enhances the safety of structures, preventing accidents and protecting lives. By ensuring that buildings and bridges are safe, we fulfill our duty to safeguard communities, reflecting the Islamic principle of preserving life.

Data privacy is treated with utmost importance (Surah An-Nur, 24:27-28). We adhere to data protection protocols, ensuring that all information is securely stored and used only for intended purposes. This respect for privacy aligns with the Islamic teaching of safeguarding personal information.

Respect is embedded in our culture (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:13). We honor our clients, employees, and stakeholders, fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding. This principle guides interactions and decision-making, ensuring ethical business practices.

Education and research (Surah Al-Alaq, 96:1-5). We invest in continuous learning and innovation, advancing technology through research. By doing so, we contribute to the broader knowledge economy, fulfilling the Islamic encouragement of seeking knowledge and excellence.

",https://www.ridescooty.com/,"I created Scooty to make public transit more accessible, drawing from my experience as an immigrant relying on it as a lifeline. Public transit isn't just a service; it's a necessity, especially for communities like ours. 

We secured the largest grant in the province's history, $1M CAD, to develop PRESTO integration—a first-ever initiative, led by Scooty's predominantly Muslim team. Our success is built on grit, a strong belief in improving public transit, and, most importantly, Duas. 

This service greatly benefits the youth, and I often share the Scooty story to inspire young people, especially from minority communities, to innovate and build, even against the odds.

The first is for women who seek a supportive and private environment to workout. Mixed-gender gyms often present challenges such as unwanted attention and a lack of access to equipment (men occupying weights). Many women, especially Muslim women, feel uncomfortable and restricted in such settings. This problem is faced in London but also elsewhere nationally/internationally. Secondly, there is a notable deficiency in education regarding female-specific health issues including menstruation, pregnancy and post-partum care. Fitness marketing that is targeted towards women is usually unhealthy and sometimes dangerous, promoting health regimes that are quick, easy and often unproven. I conducted a survey on 50 women (from the UK, mainly London) and found that 83% of women said they’d prefer to train in female-only gyms and 88% indicated that their current knowledge on feminine health was inadequate, proving the demand and problem.","The primary audience for Fitness Haven includes women of all ages and backgrounds who seek a safe, supportive, and private environment for their fitness and wellness activities. This includes teenage girls, mothers, working women, and individuals on the go. My survey reveals that the problems women face in mixed gyms include unwanted attention, equipment access issues (weight areas dominated by men) and wanting more female-focused classes and support groups. Additionally, women from conservative or religious backgrounds (incl. Muslim women) feel restricted in mixed settings. Feedback that I received included being unable to dress freely and finding it uncomfortable doing certain workout positions and postures when men are around, therefore limiting women’s workouts. Fitness Haven also targets women who wish to be better educated on female-specific health issues such as menstruation, pregnancy, post-partum recovery and conditions like PCOS, many of which affect most/all women and so all women are our audience.","In the UK and globally, approximately 51% of the population are women, with many facing barriers in mixed-gender gyms. Specific segments include teenage girls, mothers, working women, and those from religious backgrounds who prefer female-only environments for fitness. According to industry reports, the UK fitness market is valued at over £2 billion, with an increasing demand for specialised fitness solutions. Within East London alone, there are thousands of potential members, particularly in areas like Ilford and Stratford. Muslims make up 6.5% of the UK, the second largest faith, of which the women in this demographic are our market. Expanding this model nationally and globally, the market size grows exponentially, encompassing millions of women seeking safe, supportive, and education-focused fitness environments. The blog though, will already have access to the larger market due to its online presence therefore building the brand image in advance of introducing a gym in various locations.","The vision of Fitness Haven is to revolutionise women’s fitness by creating a safe, supportive, and empowering environment that addresses the unique health and wellness needs of women. Our North Star is to be the leading female-only fitness sanctuary, where women of all ages and backgrounds can pursue their fitness goals with confidence and support. We aim to provide holistic health education through our comprehensive blog, ensuring our members are well-informed about female-specific health issues. Our mission extends beyond East London; we envision rolling out Fitness Haven nationally and globally, establishing a network of gyms that uphold our values of privacy, inclusivity, and community. By expanding our model, we aspire to empower women, especially Muslim women worldwide, promoting not only physical fitness but also mental and emotional well-being. Fitness Haven is committed to giving the mothers of our Ummah a sanctuary where they can elevate themselves physically, mentally and spiritually.","Fitness Haven offers a comprehensive solution designed to meet the unique fitness and wellness needs of women. Our female-only gym features targeted equipment, classes and tablet guides that provide simple instructions on machine use and quick workout suggestions. We offer a variety of classes, including pre- and post-natal sessions and those focused on specific feminine health issues like PCOS and menopause. A dedicated prayer/meditation room caters to spiritual needs, enhancing overall well-being. Our on-site café serves nutritious meals and beverages, fostering a space for socialising and community building and therefore feels like every woman’s feminine sanctuary. Additionally, Fitness Haven includes an informative blog that covers a wide range of topics, from menstruation, pregnancy to mental health and nutrition, ensuring our members are well-educated on critical health matters. This holistic approach not only promotes physical fitness but also emotional and spiritual well-being, making Fitness Haven a sanctuary for women’s health and empowerment.","Fitness Haven differentiates itself from existing female gyms and general gyms through its holistic and comprehensive approach to women’s fitness and wellness.

This ensures our members are well-informed and empowered in their health journeys. Additionally, our facility includes features that specifically cater to women’s needs: pre- and post-natal classes, a dedicated prayer/meditation room, and a café that promotes social interaction and community building. Our state-of-the-art equipment is paired with tablet guides offering machine instructions and quick workout suggestions, making fitness accessible and efficient. By addressing the unique physical, mental, and emotional needs of women, Fitness Haven creates a supportive and inclusive environment that goes beyond traditional gym offerings, setting a new standard in women’s health and fitness.","The Prophet (pbuh) said “I urge you to take care of the women.” Sahih Al-Bukhari and “the best of you are those who are best to their women” Sunan Al-Tirmidhi. 
It is our responsibility to take care of women. To have privacy, safety and for them to look and feel their best for their families and husbands without compromising their faith. An environment where feminine health is celebrated, not a taboo or discouraged because it is within a male dominated environment. With all that our mothers, sisters and daughters endure and sacrifice whether its menstruation, pregnancy, child-birth, societal pressure and obligations, women deserve a sanctuary where they can recover and relax naturally and healthily. Islam encourages taking care of ones-self as it was reported by Abu-Huraira that the Prophet (pbuh) said that a “strong believer is more beloved to Allah than the weak believer.” This can apply to both physical and mental strength which contributes to a stronger faith and ultimately a stronger Ummah.

As of recent estimates, only about 5% of Nigerians are covered by health insurance. This is significantly lower than the global average and contrasts sharply with coverage rates in many other countries.

 Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that a substantial proportion of health expenses in Nigeria are out-of-pocket. Approximately 70% of total health expenditure is paid directly by individuals, which highlights the gap in insurance coverage.

Healthcare Financing: According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the share of health insurance in total health expenditure is minimal. Most health financing comes from personal payments rather than insurance or government funding.

These statistics underscore the challenge of expanding healthcare insurance in Nigeria, where the majority of the population remains uninsured and relies heavily on direct payments for health services.


",Low-middle income households,"In Nigeria, with a population of approximately 223 million, a significant portion falls into the low to middle-income bracket. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the World Bank indicates that around 40-50% of the population, or 89 to 111 million people, belong to this income group. Many in this demographic live on less than $2 a day, affecting their ability to afford health insurance. Despite being a substantial market, affordability remains a major barrier. The Total Addressable Market (TAM) for health insurance among these households reflects a considerable opportunity for growth, provided that insurance products are made affordable and accessible to align with their financial capabilities.
",A social venture-Takaful-based Health insurance scheme wherein all participants pool funds together to cater for health needs. The float (aggregate contributions) prior to need would serve as funding for partner Health service providers and for other healthcare based investments to increase the fund.,"-Takaful-based: It would be run specifically on Islamic principles of Takaful.

 
-Transparency: Every participant would know the exact amount that was disbursed, the returns of investments made and balance.


-Impact over profitability.

Our communities need to diversify out of tech and real-estate, but have limited halal solutions in agriculture & food production.

3. Controlling the narrative & reclaiming our traditions.  Our focus is on date production in all formats.  Why? Dates are staple in our tradition over the last millennia.  Yet the biggest exporter of date in the world is Israel.  We aspire to create a portfolio that positively reflect our tradition, educates & brings people together.

2. Retailers who would like to source ethically produced products
3. Consumers who would like to purchase and consume nutrious and clean products ",North America & Western Europe.,"Datterra - Means from the Earth

We have a vision to build a global brand and multi-tiered portfolio based on ethical farming, innovative manufacturing practices and Islamic principals.   

With a 'Barakah' mindset, we intend to do so by growing with our communities and for our communities. 

We come from a heavy FMCG global brand background.  Brands that are constantly being 'imported' to us from the west, under the pretense of 'better quality'.  We are here to shatter that pattern and shift the tide to 'Export' our products, and brands for the world to see our itkan (excellence). 

","It is important to give an overview of what we are doing, so you can understand the solution:

1. We own our own land / and are growing our own organic dates.  
2. With a pipeline to sell our own products & those of our neighbors and communities.
3. We are building a solid brand concept that will act as an umbrella 
4. We are establishing the wireframe for route to market to allow small producers to commercialize in retail, wholesale and e-commerce.  Markets they otherwise would not be able to, due to either expertise or scale.

How do we commercialize & go to market?
1. With over 20 years of FMCG experience on the team, we have access to retailers, manufacturers and distributor networks globally


Solution (for land ownership/investor):
1.  We intend to replicate the model and purchase land in bulk, in 100s or 1000s of acres.  Of which investors can pay an initial investor to own/grow/lease a plot for a fixed term.  
2.  We earn a % of the crop as our maintenance fee
3.  The investor is free to sell their products directly, or with us through a revenue share model.


Solution (For farmers)
1. We allow farmers who require funding to maintain their crop to enter 'salam' contracts.  Which is an Islamic commercial contract that allows investor and farmer 
2.  We cut the middle man: Retail products on minimum of 5 'middle' men to reach the end consumer.  By building direct to retail/distributor relationship for the producers to access, this allows them to keep a fair price for the produce.  That is sustainable for their livelihood.

3. We make selling easy:  We are a building an infrastructure for them to tap into.  So if a farmer within our network is able to secure their own buyer. They tap in, and use existing back-office structure that clears goods, customs, arranges shipping, invoice and even collection if required.

Solution (Alternate Revenue streams)
 In addition to date production, expansion plans are accessible in a wide range of manufactured goods and partnerships.

","Humbly speaking, we have not encountered a similar product/service solution that addresses agricultural and investments needs.","- Halal Financial Solutions: Providing a unique investment solution for Muslims that are looking to diversify 

- Fair pricing model: By limiting the middle-man, for the average farmer it allows them to keep more margin to improve their livelihood.  It also indirectly inspires the younger generation to maintain traditions and skills of their ancestors. 

-Ethical financing:  By financing farmers through Salam Contracts (Islamic farming contract law).  We give farmers an alternative means and avoid them being forced to enter a 'Ribba' contract.


- Educational:  We are bringing leading industry experts to our land and neighboring farms and sharing farming best practices. We have recently invited a team of agronomists from Brazil to help us analyze soil samples and provide a custom fertilizer solution that is specific to our terrain and water requirements. 


-Environmental benefits: By supporting organic farms, and local farms, we provide a sustainable solution that preserves our soil and thus acting as a true 'khalifa' of the land.

- Strengthening communities & our traditions

- Zero-waste solutions:  Our farming practices, and production is derived of zero-waste.  Every part is used, the date, the seed, the leaves through different by products to ensure zero-waste.

- Secured cold storage facilities for this year's crop 
- Assessing farmers interested in selling their dates this season through us (our farm is not yet producing)

- We are already in negotiations with interested buyers in North America and South America.  1 Key retailer, wholesaler and a chain of airport duty free.

I will choose a crop named Sesame that is easily growing and very largely growing in our country. I will use sesame seeds in making food products including sesame-fortified milk, sesame oil, and sesame sauce. Low-income households are struggling to afford cow and buffalo milk due to rising prices and limited availability. Sesame milk can significantly combat malnutrition in children due to its rich nutritional profile and versatility. Sesame Oil helps in lowering bad cholesterol levels and reduces the risk of heart disease. Its antioxidant properties also contribute to cardiovascular health by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Sesame oil and sauce is a nutritious, flavorful, and cost-effective choice for home cooking in comparison to other oils available market. The majority of the World’s population is Lactose intolerant and has a lot of digestive issues.","The target audience for my products is all kinds of people. But specifically, products will be beneficial for children and women. Sesame milk is very nutritious for the better health of both children and women. Moreover, for many sensitive people and patients who are lactose intolerant and allergic, these products are very effective for them because they are lactose-free and also very affordable. The population in Pakistan is struggling with their economy and most people are unable to buy expensive milk and oil which are also non hygenic. So sesame products are health-beneficial, cost-effective, and organic as compared to others.","Nearly 10.5 million people in Pakistan, or 29% of the population, are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity. Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has found that 2.14 million children in parts of Pakistan are suffering acute malnutrition. So Pakistan is very vulnerable to food security issues. My target is Pakistan-deprived areas. The country's
favorable climate and potential for value addition in the sesame industry
suggest that sesame milk, oil, and sauce could become a popular and sustainable choice in the future. Sesame milk is a plant-based alternative to dairy milk, gaining attention for its health benefits and sustainability. Sesame oil, derived from sesame seeds, is valued for its culinary, medicinal, and cosmetic applications. : Sesame sauce is made from sesame seeds, oil, soy sauce,
vinegar, garlic, ginger, sweeteners, and other seasonings. It is high in healthy fats, protein, vitamins (B, E), and minerals. ",My only vision and target is to provide organic and low-cost innovative food products to every person. Sesame is considered an orphan crop in agriculture. Many people do not grow it and many do not know their products' diversity and benefits. Sesame is very easy to grow and highly beneficial in terms of the food market. So I will try to promote organic foods made from beneficial crops in terms of artificial food flavors.,"Sesame milk is more affordable and cost-effective than cow and buffalo milk.
• Sesame milk and tahini past are lactose-free and are excellent options for those
who are allergic to dairy.
• Tahini paste supports gut health and improves digestive functions.
• Tahini is highly nutritious and rich in protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and
minerals, including calcium and magnesium.
• Sesame oil nourishes the skin and hair. Its vitamin E content supports skin
health.
• Sesame oil reduces the risk of heart diseases
Sesame seeds require less water than
many other crops, and the sauce has a lower carbon footprint compared to animal-based sauces. By-products can be utilized for animal feed or other food products.","My products are better than other similar products in the market because We will work hard to ensure that my sesame oil, tahini paste, and sesame milk are packed with essential nutrients like healthy fats, protein, fiber, antioxidants, calcium, and vitamins.
By providing all these products at affordable prices, I strive to make my products stand out from the competition. Additionally, my commitment to delivering products that will not only be delicious but also nutritionally beneficial.","I will maintain;

2. Churn rate is too high.

Even if they somehow find a way to monetize their knowledge by charging monthly subscribtions, students churn rate is too high, meaning only small amount of students stay for the next months. We gamified it.

3. Lots of people can't afford expensive courses
